= WINE TASTING

http://tkblog.herokuapp.com/

A simple, scrappy site built from scratch (Rails, with assists from pagination & bootstrap). Mostly serves to function as a non-scaling collection of pictures which are from a trip I took to California with Katie. 

Lower-right nav functions will eventually include not only all pictures, but pictures/info grouped by day, and by winery.
