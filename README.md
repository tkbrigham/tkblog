== WINE TASTING

A simple, scrappy site built from scratch (Rails with assists from pagination & bootstrap). Mostly serves to function as a non-scaling collection of pictures which are representative of a trip I took to California with Katie. Lower-right nav functions will eventually include not only all pictures, but pictures/info grouped by day, and by winery.
